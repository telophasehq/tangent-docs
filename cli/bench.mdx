Run synthetic load against your pipeline to validate throughput and latency.

```bash
tangent bench \
  --config tangent.yaml \
  --seconds 30 \
  --payload tests/input.json
````

**Output (example)**

```
INFO tangent_bench::socket: ===Starting socket_main benchmark===

Bench in CI before you ship changes to a critical transform.

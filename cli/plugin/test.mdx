Execute plugin tests against fixtures to prevent regressions.

```bash
tangent plugin test --config tangent.yaml
````

Tests are configured in `tangent.yaml`
Example:
```yaml
plugins:
  zeek:
    module_type: go
    path: .
    tests:
      - input: tests/conn.json
        expected:  tests/conn_out.json
```

**Good tests cover**

* Input edge cases (missing fields, arrays, nulls)
* Schema mapping (e.g., OCSF)
* Error handling (drop/route to different sinks, annotate with reasons)

Run tests locally and in CI.

Tangent cli ships with everything you need to develop, test, benchmark, and run your own transforms:
* `tangent scaffold` – generate a plugin boilerplate in Go or Python
* `tangent compile-wasm` – compile to a .wasm component
* `tangent test` – validate correctness of transformations
* `tangent bench` – measure throughput and latency before deploying
* `tangent run` – to start the tangent runtime

## Fields

### `path` (required)

Path to your WASM plugin entrypoint (e.g., `wrapper.go`, `main.py`, `.` for module root). This is used by `compile-wasm` command.

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
entry_point: main.py
```

### `module_type` (required)

The language used by your WASM plugin. This is used by `compile-wasm` command.

Options: `go`, `py`

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
module_type: go
```

### `batch_size` (optional)

Tangent buffers logs in memory before flushing to your WASM plugin. Logs are flushed when either `batch_size` or `batch_age` is reached.

`batch_size` configures the maximum size of logs to buffer before flushing, in KB (default: 256).

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
batch_size: 1024
```

### `batch_age` (optional)

Tangent buffers logs in memory before flushing to your WASM plugin. Logs are flushed when either `batch_size` or `batch_age` is reached.

`batch_age` configures the maximum time logs will be buffered before flushing, in milliseconds (default: 5)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
batch_age: 5
```

### `workers` (optional)

Number of workers threads to spawn (default: number of CPUs)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
workers: 16
```

### `sources` (required)

Configure log sources. See [Sources](/sources/overview)

Pulling from multiple sources is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
```

### `sinks` (required)

Configure log sinks. See [Sources](/sinks/overview)

Sinking into multiple sinks is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sinks:
  s3_bucket:
    type: s3
    bucket_name: my-bucket
```

## Full Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
module_type: go
entry_point: .
batch_size: 1024      # KB
batch_age: 10         # ms
workers: 4

sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"

sinks:
  s3_bucket:
    type: s3
    bucket_name: my-bucket
```

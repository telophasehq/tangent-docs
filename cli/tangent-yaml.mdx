## Runtime
<ParamField path="plugins_path" type="string">
  Path to your compiled plugins. default: `plugins/`

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  path: plugins/
```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="batch_size" type="int">
Maximum size (in KB) of logs buffered in memory before being flushed to your WASM plugin.  
Defaults to `256 KB`.

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  batch_size: 1024
```
</ParamField>


<ParamField path="batch_age" type="int">
Maximum time (in milliseconds) logs will be buffered before being flushed to your WASM plugin.  
Defaults to `5 ms`.


```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  batch_age: 5
```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="workers" type="int">
Number of workers threads to spawn (default: number of CPUs)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  workers: 16
```
</ParamField>

## `plugins`

Each plugin is defined under a user-chosen key (e.g. golang) that you can reference in the DAG.

<ParamField path="module_type" type="string" required>
The language used by your WASM plugin. This is used by `compile-wasm` command.

Options: `go`, `py`

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    module_type: go
```
</ParamField>


<ParamField path="path" type="string" required>
Path to your plugin _entry point_. For Golang, this is `.`. For Python, its the name of a file e.g. `mapper.py`.

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    path: mapper.py
```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tests" type="map">
Path to your plugin test `input` and `expected` output. 


```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    tests:
      - input: tests/input.json
        expected: tests/expected.json
```
</ParamField>

## `sources`

Configure log sources. See [Sources](/sources/overview)

Pulling from multiple sources is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
```

## `sinks`

Configure log sinks. See [Sources](/sinks/overview)

Sinking into multiple sinks is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sinks:
  s3_bucket:
    type: s3
    bucket_name: my-bucket
```

## `dag`

Defines the **dataflow graph** (Directed Acyclic Graph) that connects sources, plugins, and sinks in your pipeline.
Each entry describes how data should flow **from one node to one or more downstream nodes**.

Tangent executes your pipeline according to this graph — logs enter from a **source**, are processed by one or more **plugins**, and finally written to **sinks**.

Each node has:

* `kind`: the type of node — `source`, `plugin`, or `sink`
* `name`: the name of the node defined elsewhere in your config (e.g. under `sources:`, `plugins:`, or `sinks:`)

### Example

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
dag:
  - from:
      kind: source
      name: socket_main
    to:
      - kind: plugin
        name: golang

  - from:
      kind: plugin
      name: golang
    to:
      - kind: sink
        name: blackhole
```

In this example:

1. Logs flow **from** the `socket_main` source
2. **Through** the `golang` plugin (which transforms or enriches them)
3. **To** the `blackhole` sink (which receives the final output)

You can chain multiple plugins or send data to multiple destinations by adding more `to:` entries.


## Full Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  plugins_path: "plugins/"
plugins:
  golang:
    module_type: go
    path: .
    tests:
      - input: tests/input.json
        expected: tests/expected.json
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
sinks:
  blackhole:
    type: blackhole
dag:
  - from:
      kind: source
      name: socket_main
    to:
      - kind: plugin
        name: golang

  - from:
      kind: plugin
      name: golang
    to:
      - kind: sink
        name: blackhole

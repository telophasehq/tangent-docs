## Runtime

### `plugins_path`
Required

Path to your compiled plugins. default: `plugins/`

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  path: plugins/
```

### `batch_size`

Tangent buffers logs in memory before flushing to your WASM plugin. Logs are flushed when either `batch_size` or `batch_age` is reached.

`batch_size` configures the maximum size of logs to buffer before flushing, in KB (default: 256).

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  batch_size: 1024
```

### `batch_age`

Tangent buffers logs in memory before flushing to your WASM plugin. Logs are flushed when either `batch_size` or `batch_age` is reached.

`batch_age` configures the maximum time logs will be buffered before flushing, in milliseconds (default: 5)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  batch_age: 5
```

### `workers`

Number of workers threads to spawn (default: number of CPUs)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  workers: 16
```

## `plugins`

### `module_type`
Required

The language used by your WASM plugin. This is used by `compile-wasm` command.

Options: `go`, `py`

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    module_type: go
```

### `path`
Required

Path to your plugin _entry point_. For Golang, this is `.`. For Python, its the name of a file e.g. `mapper.py`.

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    path: mapper.py
```

### `tests`

Path to your plugin test `input` and `expected` output. 


```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    tests:
      - input: tests/input.json
        expected: tests/expected.json
```

Example:
```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
plugins:
  golang: # name of your plugin
    module_type: go
    path: .
    tests:
      - input: tests/input.json
        expected: tests/expected.json
```

## `sources`

Configure log sources. See [Sources](/sources/overview)

Pulling from multiple sources is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
```

## `sinks`

Configure log sinks. See [Sources](/sinks/overview)

Sinking into multiple sinks is not yet supported.

Example:

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
sinks:
  s3_bucket:
    type: s3
    bucket_name: my-bucket
```

## `dag`
Configures the 

Example
```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
dag:
  - from:
      kind: source
      name: socket_main
    to:
      - kind: plugin
        name: golang

  - from:
      kind: plugin
      name: golang
    to:
      - kind: sink
        name: blackhole
```

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  plugins_path: "plugins/"
plugins:
  golang:
    module_type: go
    path: .
    tests:
      - input: tests/input.json
        expected: tests/expected.json
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
sinks:
  blackhole:
    type: blackhole
dag:
  - from:
      kind: source
      name: socket_main
    to:
      - kind: plugin
        name: golang

  - from:
      kind: plugin
      name: golang
    to:
      - kind: sink
        name: blackhole

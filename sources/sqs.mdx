title: "SQS Source"
description: "Ingest logs and messages from Amazon SQS queues."
---

The **SQS source** allows Tangent to consume messages directly from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.  
This is useful for event-driven pipelines, asynchronous log forwarding, or integrating with other AWS services that publish to SQS.

---

<ParamField path="queue_url" type="string" required>
The full URL of the SQS queue to poll.  
Example: `https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="wait_time_seconds" type="int">
Long polling duration in seconds.  
Controls how long Tangent waits for messages before returning an empty response.  
Defaults to `20`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="visibility_timeout" type="int">
The duration (in seconds) that a message remains invisible to other consumers after Tangent retrieves it.  
Defaults to `60`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="decoding" type="object">
Controls how Tangent parses message payloads after retrieval.  
See [Decoding](/sources/decoding) for supported formats (`json`, `ndjson`, `msgpack`, etc.).
</ParamField>

## Example

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=cloud
sources:
  sqs_logs:
    type: sqs
    queue_url: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/app-logs"
    wait_time_seconds: 20
    visibility_timeout: 60
    decoding:
      format: json
      compression: auto
````

---

## Behavior

* Tangent uses the AWS SDK to long-poll the specified queue for messages.
* When a message arrives:

  * The payload is decoded according to the `decoding` configuration.
  * Each decoded record is passed into the pipeline.
* Messages are automatically deleted after successful processing.
* Visibility timeouts prevent duplicate processing in concurrent consumers.

---

## Best Practices

* **Keep `wait_time_seconds` high (e.g., 20s)** to reduce API calls and costs.
* **Ensure the IAM role or credentials** used by Tangent have `sqs:ReceiveMessage` and `sqs:DeleteMessage` permissions.
* **Tune `visibility_timeout`** to be slightly longer than your typical plugin or sink processing time to avoid message re-delivery.
* Use `decoding.format: json` or `ndjson` for structured logs, or `text` for plain message bodies.

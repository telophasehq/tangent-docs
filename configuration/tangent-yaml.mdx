description: "Top-level config that wires Runtime, Plugins, Sources, Sinks, and the DAG."
---

`tangent.yaml` declares how Tangent runs: **Runtime** controls batching and workers, **Plugins** define WASM modules, **Sources** and **Sinks** define I/O, and the **DAG** connects them.

Use this page as a map; see the dedicated pages for full schemas and examples:
- [Runtime](/configuration/runtime)
- [Plugins](/configuration/plugins)
- [DAG](/configuration/dag)
- [Sources](/configuration/sources/overview)
- [Sinks](/configuration/sinks/overview)

## Minimal example

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  plugins_path: "plugins/"
  batch_size: 256
  batch_age: 5
  workers: 16

plugins:
  golang:
    module_type: go
    path: .

sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"

sinks:
  blackhole:
    type: blackhole

dag:
  - from: { kind: source, name: socket_main }
    to:
      - { kind: plugin, name: golang }
  - from: { kind: plugin, name: golang }
    to:
      - { kind: sink, name: blackhole }

## What lives where

### Runtime

Batching, worker threads, and where compiled plugins live.
See [Runtime](/configuration/runtime).

### Plugins

Define each WASM plugin (language, entry point, tests).
See [Plugins](/configuration/plugins).

### Sources

Where logs come from (Socket, MSK, SQS, File), plus decoding.
See [Sources](/configuration/sources/overview).

### Sinks

Where records go (S3, File, Blackhole), plus encoding/compression.
See [Sinks](/configuration/sinks/overview).

### DAG

Connect sources → plugins → sinks; the pipeline’s dataflow graph.
See [DAG](/configuration/dag).

## Notes

* Under `runtime`, the key is **`plugins_path`** (not `path`).
* “Number of **worker** threads” (not “workers threads”).
* In the **Sources** example, the key is `socket_path`.
* In the **Sinks** blurb/link, say “See **Sinks**” (not “See Sources”).
* The DAG must remain acyclic; you can fan-out to multiple `to:` nodes.

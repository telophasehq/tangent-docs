title: "Socket"
description: "Ingest logs from a local Unix domain socket."
---

The **Socket source** allows Tangent to consume logs from a local Unix domain socket (UDS).  
This is the simplest way to connect local producers (e.g. agents, sidecars, or log forwarders) directly to Tangent.

---

## Schema
<ParamField path="socket_path" type="string" required>
Path to the Unix domain socket used for ingestion.  
Defaults to `/tmp/sidecar.sock`.
</ParamField>

---

## Example

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=plug
sources:
  socket_main:
    type: socket
    socket_path: "/tmp/sidecar.sock"
    decoding:
      format: ndjson
      compression: auto
````

---

## Behavior

* Tangent listens on the provided socket path and accepts connections from any local producer process.
* Producers can write NDJSON or JSON payloads to the socket â€” Tangent decodes them according to the configured `decoding` section.
* When the source closes, Tangent flushes any buffered messages before shutdown.

## Common Use Cases

| Use Case                 | Example                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local log forwarder      | An app writes logs to `/tmp/sidecar.sock` instead of stdout           |
| Sidecar integration      | Send structured logs from a container to Tangent                      |
| Testing and benchmarking | Use the Tangent CLI to `bench` or `run` against a local socket source |

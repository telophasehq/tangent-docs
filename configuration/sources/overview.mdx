description: "Ingest data from sockets, queues, files, or streaming systems."
---

Sources define **where Tangent reads data from** — for example, a local Unix socket, Amazon SQS queue, file, or Kafka/MSK topic.  
Each source reads raw bytes, applies a configured [`decoding`](/configuration/sources/decoding) policy, and emits structured records into Tangent’s pipeline.

---

## Source Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| [`socket`](/configuration/sources/socket) | Local Unix domain socket (fastest for local ingestion) | `/tmp/sidecar.sock` |
| [`file`](/configuration/sources/file) | Read structured logs from local or mounted files | `/var/log/app/access.log` |
| [`msk`](/configuration/sources/msk) | Consume from Amazon MSK (Kafka) topics | `b-1.example.com:9092` |
| [`sqs`](/configuration/sources/sqs) | Poll messages from Amazon SQS queues | `https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/...` |

---

## Common Configuration

Every source supports a few shared parameters:

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
Selects the source type.  
One of: `socket`, `file`, `msk`, or `sqs`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="decoding" type="object">
Defines how incoming bytes are parsed into structured records.  
See [Decoding](/sources/decoding) for format and compression options.
</ParamField>

## Example (MSK Source)

```yaml tangent.yaml icon=download
sources:
  kafka_in:
    type: msk
    bootstrap_servers: "b-1.example.com:9092,b-2.example.com:9092"
    topic: logs
    group_id: tangent-node
    decoding:
      format: ndjson
      compression: auto
````

## Behavior

* Each source runs in its own async worker, managed by Tangent’s runtime.
* Data is read continuously, batched in memory, and flushed based on runtime settings (`batch_size` / `batch_age`).
* Decoding and optional re-encoding happen before the data enters the plugin or sink DAG.

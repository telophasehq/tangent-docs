title: "DAG"
description: "Define the dataflow graph connecting sources, plugins, and sinks."
---

The **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines how data flows through your Tangent pipeline.

---

## Schema
<ParamField path="dag" type="list">
Each entry describes a flow from one node to one or more downstream nodes.



* `from.kind`: `source`, `plugin`, or `sink`
* `from.name`: name of the node
* `to`: list of destination nodes
</ParamField>

---

## Example
```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
dag:
  - from:
      kind: source
      name: socket_main
    to:
      - kind: plugin
        name: golang
  - from:
      kind: plugin
      name: golang
    to:
      - kind: sink
        name: blackhole
````

### ðŸ§  Notes

* The DAG determines execution order.
* Multiple plugins or sinks can receive data from one source.
* Cycles are not allowed (it must remain acyclic).

title: "Runtime"
description: "Control batching, worker threads, and plugin paths."
---

The **Runtime** section configures how Tangent executes and batches logs in memory before handing them to plugins.

---

## Schema
<ParamField path="plugins_path" type="string">
Path to compiled plugins. Defaults to `plugins/`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="batch_size" type="int">
Maximum buffered size (KB) before flushing. Defaults to `256`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="batch_age" type="int">
Maximum time (ms) logs are buffered before flush. Defaults to `5`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="workers" type="int">
Number of worker threads to spawn. Defaults to the number of CPUs.
</ParamField>

## Example
```yaml tangent.yaml icon=settings
runtime:
  plugins_path: "plugins/"
  batch_size: 1024
  batch_age: 5
  workers: 16
````

### ðŸ§  Notes

* `batch_size` and `batch_age` together control flush cadence.
* `workers` determines concurrency; higher values increase throughput.
